# Red Dead Redemption 2: Bounties Expansion - RDR1 Edition
The RDR1 Version is basically the same as the Main Version. Only a couple of bounties have been changed.
The Main Version holds 7 unique bounties. These have their own little story and objective to them apart from the bounties with bodyguards and such.﻿The RDR1 Edition changes the unique bounties to be like the other bounties. With bodyguards, detection and all. These bounties are made to look like the ﻿ones present in RDR1. That's why it is called the RDR1 Edition.
